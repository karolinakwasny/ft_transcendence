# ft_transcendence

A full-stack web application, integrating modern web technologies and working across both front-end and back-end systems.

This project is part of the core curriculum at 42 Schools and aims to familiarize students with common technologies used in full-stack development.

## Live Demo

Check out the live version of the project here: [**Live Demo**](https://transcendence-cs0d.onrender.com/)

**Note:**  
- This application is hosted entirely on free-tier services.  
- As a result, the initial load may take **50 seconds or more** if the app has been inactive.  
- This delay happens because the server enters a sleep state after **15 minutes** of inactivity.  
- Once active, the app runs smoothly.

---

## Deployment Details

The project is fully deployed using free-tier cloud services:

- **[Neon](https://neon.tech/):** PostgreSQL database hosting.
- **[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/):** Image storage and delivery.
- **[Render](https://render.com/):** Hosting for both the frontend (React) and backend (Django) using containerized services via Blueprints.
